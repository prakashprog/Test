A new repo from an existing project
Say you’ve got an existing project that you want to start tracking with git.

Go into the directory containing the project.
Type git init.
Type git add to add all of the relevant files.
You’ll probably want to create a .gitignore file right away, to indicate all of the files you don’t want to track. Use git add .gitignore, too.
Type git commit.
